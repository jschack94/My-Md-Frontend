# My MD


## Live Demo
Play around with the [live demo here](
https://jschack94.github.io/My-Md-Frontend/). Please use the email address "doctor@hospital.com" to sign in.

## Installing Locally

1. Follow on the links for both the [frontend](https://github.com/jschack94/My-Md-Frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/linsuri/hatch-backend).
2. Clone both of them down into separate folders on your computer.
3. In the command line, `cd` into the backend folder and run `bundle install`.
4. Run `rails s` to start your backend server. It should run on `localhost:3000`.
5. Open another tab in your command line, `cd` into the backend folder and run `npm install`.

6. Run `npm start` to start your frontend server. If you are prompted to run the server on a different port than your backend, type `y`. Your frontend server should run on `localhost:3001`.

After you run `npm start`, a tab in your browser should open automatically. Go ahead and sign in using "doctor@hospital.com"
